Calibration Adjustment Task
- Detect trend
 - want to remove trend for especially sloping sensor data (in general, trend SHOULD be flat to represent resting level)
- Detect seasonality (eating times always cause spikes, etc.)
 - basically want to filter this out to get the baseline, resting glucose level, which we want to line up sensor to sensor
